# GoogleCloudAIInActionData
This repository hosts the source code to prepare asteroid data for the 2025 Google Cloud AI in Action Hackathon. This project focuses on using MongoDB to store asteroid data for vector search and insights extracted with generative Artificial Intelligence.

This repository provides the instructions to set up MongoDB, prepare the asteroid data and import the data in the database.

## Environment Set-up
Ensure that [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) is installed on your device.

Ensure that [Python (version 3.9.0 or above)](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is installed on your device.

Enter a safe directory on your device.
```
cd <PATH-TO-SAFE-DIRECTORY>
```

Clone this repository in the safe directory.
```
git clone https://github.com/mctechspot/GoogleCloudAIInActionData
```

Enter root directory of repository.
```
cd <PATH-TO-SAFE-DIRECTORY>/GoogleCloudAIInActionData
```

Create a Python virtual environment.
```
python3 -m venv .venv
```

Activate virtual environment.
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install requisite libraries.
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Establish MongoDB database
Pull MongoDB community server docker image.
```
docker pull mongodb/mongodb-community-server:latest
```

Confirm that MongoDB Community Server docker image was successfully pulled. 
```
docker image ls | grep mongodb
```

The output should list the image as follows.
```
mongodb/mongodb-community-server   latest    <IMAGE_ID>   <CREATED>   1.74GB
``` 

Run mongodb as a container. The internal port used by the MongoDB container is 27017. However, you may choose to map any local port to the container if the local port 27017 is in use for something else.

Establish authentication variables for the database. You determine the values fo the following variables
```
DB_USER="Choose_an_appropriate_database_username"
DB_PASSWORD="Choose_an_appropriate_database_password"
DB_PORT=Choose_an_appropriate_database_local_port_number
```

Run the MongoDB container with the appropriate credentials that you have chosen.
```
docker run --name mongodb -p <DB_PORT>:27017 \
-e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=<DB_USER> \
-e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=<DB_PASSWORD>> \
-d mongodb/mongodb-community-server:latest
```

Ensure that the MongoDB container is running.
```
docker ps | grep mongodb
```

The output should look like this. Pay close attention to the status. It should say **up**.
```
<CONTAINER_ID>   mongodb/mongodb-community-server:latest   "python3 /usr/local/â€¦"   <CREATED_AT>      Up <UP_TIME>    0.0.0.0:<DB_PORT>->27017/tcp   mongodb-container
```

Enter the container to interact with the MongoDB command line.
```
docker exec -it mongodb bash
```

Inside the container, connect to the database.
```
mongosh --port <DB_PORT> -u <DB_USER> -p <DB_PASSWORD> --authenticationDatabase admin
```

You should by default be logged into the admin database. Create a new database called asteroids.
```
use asteroids
```

You will be switched to the database called asteroids. If you type the command ``show dbs`` to see the existing dbs, the  asteroids database will not be listed. A database is only listed when it is populated. We are about to do that now.

## Prepare Data
Download the requisite data at this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravkumar2525/asteroids-dataset). Extract the _asteroid_data.csv_ file and store it in a safe directory on your device.

Create a .env file to store secrets.
```
touch .env

chmod 744 .env
```

Add relevant variables to .env file. Check the .env.example file to see the relevant variables that need to be added
```
DATA_PATH=<Path_to_aseroids_data>
DB_HOST=0.0.0.0
DB_USER=<Database_user> # DB_USER defined when running MongoDB container
DB_PASSWORD=<Database_password> # DB_PASSWORD defined when running MongoDB container
DB_NAME=<Database_name> # asteroids
DB_PORT=<Database_port> # DB_PORT defined when running MongoDB container
COLLECTION_ORBIT_CLASS_TYPES="orbit_class_types"
COLLECTION_ASTEROIDS="asteroids"
```

Execute the bash script that runs the data_preparation.ipynb file to generate the data.
```
bash data_generation.sh
```

Two JSON files should be generated in a directory called data.
```
- \data
    - aseroids.json
    - orbit_class_types.json
```

Once the JSON files have been generated, it is time to import them with the mongodb-import.sh script.
```
bash mongodb-import.sh
```

The output should show that data was imported into the orbit_class_types and asteroids collection of the asteroids database.
```

<TIMESTAMP>    4 document(s) imported successfully. 0 document(s) failed to import.
<TIMESTAMP>    connected to: mongodb://[**REDACTED**]@0.0.0.0:<DB_PORT>/asteroids?authSource=admin

```
